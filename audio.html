                This is an audio project where I tried to make it sound like a guy was trying to steal a car, but it's
                hard to understand the exact content from the listeners without this description. In order to merge all the
                audio and make them sound like they were on the same layer, I had to add fade-in and fade-out effects to
                each one. Also, some of the audio I used was very quiet, so I had to adjust the volume individually. The
                background breathing sound was hard to find, and the breathing sound was so quiet that it was easy for
                the breathing sound to be completely covered up when other sounds were playing.
